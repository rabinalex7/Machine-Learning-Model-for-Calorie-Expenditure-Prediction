# Machine Learning Model for Calorie Expenditure Prediction
A machine learning project to predict calorie expenditure using physiological and activity data. Includes preprocessing, EDA, multiple regression models, and performance evaluation for fitness, healthcare, and personalized wellness applications.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The Calorie Expenditure Prediction Model is a machine learning project aimed at estimating the number of calories burned by an individual based on physiological characteristics and activity-related metrics. With the growing demand for fitness tracking and personalized health solutions, accurately predicting calorie expenditure plays an important role in diet planning, workout optimization, and healthcare monitoring.

The dataset used in this project includes variables such as age, gender, height, weight, body temperature, and heart rate, which are all significant factors influencing energy expenditure. Before model development, extensive data preprocessing is carried out, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. This ensures the dataset is clean, consistent, and suitable for machine learning algorithms.

To better understand the relationships within the dataset, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed. Correlation heatmaps, distribution plots, and trend analyses highlight how certain features, like weight and heart rate, directly impact calorie burn. These insights are not only useful for model building but also provide valuable domain understanding.

Multiple machine learning models are implemented and compared, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest. Each model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R¬≤ Score to assess prediction accuracy. Visualization of predicted vs actual calorie expenditure further demonstrates the performance of the models and helps identify the most reliable approach.

The final output of this project is a predictive system that can estimate calorie burn given a set of input parameters. Such a model has practical applications in fitness apps, wearable devices, healthcare systems, and personal wellness programs, where accurate calorie estimation can guide lifestyle and training decisions.
